# Online Compiler using Web Development

The topic we have undertaken for the mini project is <italic>Online Compiler for Web-Development</italic>.
Compilers play an important role in running programs. It converts source code written in the form of text into an executable format known as the object code. 
If a compiler is made to run manually on every system it will occupy a lot of space on the machine.<br>

It would also require proper configuration if it is not installed using default parameters. 
In todayâ€™s world most of the applications and their associated interfaces are made to work online. 
So we have focused on the development of an Online Compiler for our mini project.<br>

The main objective of the online compiler project is to help students who want to learn web development without installing a compiler in their system. 
This application focuses on solving the problem of storage and portability of the system.<br>

Sometimes, the user has to switch between various websites in order to find all the coding languages (HTML, CSS and JavaScript). 
We are eliminating that problem by embedding those 3 languages in a single environment, where users can switch between the categories just by a button.
The Online Compiler uses following softwares <strong> HTML, CSS, Java Script, and JQUERY.</strong><br>
